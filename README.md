If you are familiar with the Web frontend technologies and are interested in source code, you can run this program using the following commands:

```sh
npm install # pnpm install
npm run dev
```

I recommend you read reading the article ["Audio Visualization: Sampling, Frequency and Fourier Transform"](https://cjting.me/2021/08/07/fourier-transform-and-audio-visualization/) first. Then, explore the source code of [`FrequencyAnalyzer`](./src/visualizers/core/FrequencyAnalyzer.ts) in this project to better understand the core logic behind it.

If you'd like to add more visualization effects, you can refer to the source code in [`visualizers/builder`](./src/visualizers/builder), and follow these steps:
- Create a new folder called `YourEffect` under this path
- Add two files `index.ts` and `Svg.tsx`
- Implement your custom feature
